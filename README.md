## Steps to configure this on your local computer. (Windows and Mac)

Though I haven't try running on Mac or Ubuntu. But these steps should definitely work on Mac as well. Let me know if you face any issues. It would strong recommend to try on Windows Machine if it's available. You can setup this in VS code IDE.

1. Clone this repo on your local computer. 
2. Open the folder in VS code and run this command "dotnet build" in the terminal. This will build the project.
3. Now run "dotnet run" which will run the application.

There are two txt files within the root folder with names input.txt and output.txt
You can replace the content in input file for running different testcases and once you run the application (dotnet run)
it will write it in output.txt
